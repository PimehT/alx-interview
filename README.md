## Directory Structure

- `0x00-pascal_triangle`: Pascal's Triangle project.
- `0x01-lockboxes`: Lockboxes project.

## Projects

### 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

This project involves generating Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

### 0x01. Lockboxes

This project involves determining if all the boxes in a list of locked boxes can be opened. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and a key with the same number as a box opens that box.
