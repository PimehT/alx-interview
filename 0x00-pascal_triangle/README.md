# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

This directory contains the Pascal's Triangle project, part of the ALX interview preparation series. The goal is to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand lists and list comprehensions.
- Define and use functions in Python.
- Implement loops and conditional statements.
- Work with indexing and slicing.
- Explore recursion (optional).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A code editor (e.g., Vim, VS Code, PyCharm)

## Project Files

- `0-pascal_triangle.py`: Python script that contains the function to generate Pascal's Triangle.
- `0-main.py`: Python script to test the `pascal_triangle` function.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and its structure.

## Usage

To generate Pascal's Triangle, run the `0-main.py` script:

```bash
./0-main.py
```
